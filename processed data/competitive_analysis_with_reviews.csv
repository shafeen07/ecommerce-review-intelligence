BEST GIFT EVER!  How did I ever live without it!! | [5 stars] I enjoy having Alexa in almost every room so I can listen to my favorite radio and TV stations.  I've been using it as an intercom, too, so I can call my husband instead of shouting or walking to the other end of the house.  We've also gotten used to asking Alexa all kinds of questions...most of which get answered. | [5 stars] It was easy to set up and she responds quickly to my voice.  I did not know she can find books on Audible so I get to listen to books on tape which is awesome.  She responds to my friends' voices as well without hesitation.  I use Alexa to play rain sounds as I try to go to sleep....pretty awesome.  Love, Love, Love it! | [5 stars] I usually buy one or two of these on Prime Days when they sell for about $25 each. I have all the Amazon Dots and Echoes that I need in my house, but these make great gifts for most anyone— especially for last minute gifts and for people that are hard to figure out what to get. I especially love giving one to someone who’s never used Alexa before. They have so much fun.<br /><br />It’s a that keep on giving! | [5 stars] The Dot was a gift to me.  I have just begun with her.<br />My vision is very limited and I can now listen to my Audible books easily, adjust the volume, pause and start again at my convenience.<br />That is so wonderful and I will be exploring more of what Alexia has to offewr.<br />She does answer almost any question I can think of!"

I was very happy with this purchase! | [5 stars] This mount looks and feels more expensive than it is. Not only is it universal, but holds up our 65"" inch TV no problem. Also, it seems like all their parts and pieces they use are made specifically for the Cheetah brand and have little paw prints, so I think that's why its relatively inexpensive - they aren't selling you a product third party. | [5 stars] Works great... comes with good hardware, which is uncommon for most TV stands.

LOVE ARITCULATING FEATURE, SO MUCH EASIER TO ATTACH EXTRAS. NEVER BUY ANOTHER FLAT MOUNT TV WALL MOUNT. THIS ONE OR NEXT SIZE UP ONLY | [5 stars] Great wallmount. Not extremely difficult to install. Did take 2 people. It's holding up well and I still really like it! | [5 stars] great mount, easy to use, make sure you mount your tv on a stud when mounting it on a wall though!!"

Wish they would develop these in a white color (not just the ""inside"" version) - but we are firm Blink supporters.  We have 2 full systems and as long as you have wifi connection, they work well - no monthly fees.  I will say - keep in mind - each of your systems is limited to 10 cameras total. | [5 stars] I don’t understand people complaining about $10 a month!! I have 4 cameras that I can change the settings on at any time.  Check my home inside and out.  I think it’s the best deal around!! | [5 stars] Great product. Can keep an eye on things while away.  I have 5 cameras. I am now buying another set for outdoors.  I have dogs & can keep an eye out. | [5 stars] We have a family compound and all our homes have these outside. You definitely need these in this dangerous day and age! Dont be caught off guard! | [1 stars] STOP- THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU MAY THINK IT IS. After the 30 days free trial, your cameras will no longer record events to review UNLESS YOU PAY 100.00+  A YEAR FOR A SUBSCRIPTION.  WITHOUT A PAID subscription.. if at 2 pm someone is on your back deck taking your grill and you sleep through it... you will have NO RECORDED FOOTAGE. YOU CAN NOT GO BACK AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED."

It no longer fast charges and it takes forever for anything to finish. I just can't seem to find a cable that will hold up. | [5 stars] Strong cables, great value and works fine in charging my android up quickly and consistently! Plenty long enough for charging and watching at the same time! | [5 stars] This charger is so fast! 3 to 4 times faster than my Samsung phone cord. Also like the long cord. | [5 stars] I am getting the last cord out of the box and thought I'd update my review..I see I never did review, but need to.<br />I bought this 3 pack of charger cords in December 2019! Yes 3 years ago and I am just getting the 3rd cord out, and I have to say I'm very hard on cords. I travel alot, grandkids and dogs keep things busy and falling, charger cables get put to the test, but these pass every test. The length is great too.<br />I recommend these and will buy more for sure!"

Wow, the sound is remarkably excellent. With all speakers like this, you have remember to raise the volume on the master audio source, which for us was the Kindle.  To achieve the rich, full sound, make sure the source volume is up enough to drive speaker. | [5 stars] I love this speaker, especially for the price!  I have a couple Marley speakers but I wanted something for camping that was durable , inexpensive and portable.  This speaker here fits all these needs and more.  I likely would not have spent $150+ on a Marley speaker had I bought this one first.  This being said, I am unable to comment on the longevity of the speaker life since it's relatively new to me and I've yet to give it a full work out. | [5 stars] I am very pleased with this speaker.  It holds a charge forever.  Has awesome sound and super easy to link up with my blue tooth.  I would definitely recommend it! | [5 stars] Gives a weird beeping noise when power is low. The blue circle on top is the volume control. If one touches a certain angle, the sound stops. But no complaints. | [1 stars] Bought this to use with Alexa but now it won’t pair.  Very disappointing!"

And for the price, you can't afford NOT to have one! It has everything you need and now that I'm in my 50s, I like the larger screen (8&#34;). My sister has the one with Alexa built in, which she loves, but I don't miss it. Even the ads which pop up when you turn it on isn't an issue, it's just a swipe and you get right in. I watch movies, play games, check email, order more stuff ;), etc. on mine. My sister uses hers as an additional &#34;computer&#34; from her work laptop. | [5 stars] Great purchase.  Price was great and it works wonderfully.  Very happy I bought this to replace my Samsung Galaxy Tablet. | [5 stars] I was looking for a tablet to update my kindle and this is perfect!  The size is just right, the colors are bright, and it works well with my Amazon Prime account.  The best thing was the price, you can't beat it for this device. | [1 stars] Worst fire tabI ever bought. This one freezes, turns off. Would not recommend | [5 stars] I I received this New Fire HD 8 Tablet as a Christmas gift, and I must say that I am very pleased with it!  It was very easy to set up, and has been working great! I have had no problems with it thus far.  It seems like a really awesome Tablet!"

I can’t wait to do more intricate drawings as I continue to learn how to use it best! | [5 stars] SET WAS SO SIMPLE AND IT JUST WHAT I NEEDED, MINUS THE PRICE OF A NAME BRAND AIR PEN! I’M SO HAPPY I PURCHASED IT! | [5 stars] Easy instructions!  Well made/construction quality materials. Ease of use. Comes with an extra fine nib for writing in smaller areas. | [5 stars] I had bought an actual Apple Pencil and it barely worked. It would miss marks consistently and wasn’t consistent. After having it for a year and it breaking, I decided I wanted something cheaper that does the same thing and what I recieved was this amazing pencil! It’s flawless when writing notes and it’s smooth. It has a sensor on the top to turn on and off and charged with a cord. Doesn’t take long to charge at all. Awesome product I’m satisfied!

What doesn’t have Bluetooth these days,  I realize this was a cheap tablet but come on. | [5 stars] This is the very best gift I have ever received!  My vision is increasingly impaired.  My Fire blows up print so I can actually read books, it will read to me as well.<br />I am only just getting into taking advantage of everything it offers.<br />It retains power for very long periods of use.  I love it! | [5 stars] The fire is great. I can tell Alexa to have it connect to my headphones and it happens | [5 stars] I think it is wonderful.  My husband (82 years old) is having some difficulty getting familiar with the kindle book with audio.  He will get it, I think.  It is a bit different than his older Kindle Fire. | [1 stars] Really, really slow to load every single page. Its really cheap and i regret wasting what little money i spent."
